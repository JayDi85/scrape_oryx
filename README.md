# Scrape Oryx
## About
This is a simple R script designed to scrape data from Oryx' excellent post detailing materiel lost by all sides in the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html) and to output it into csv format.

Up-to-date output datasets can be found at in the [oryx_data](https://github.com/scarnecchia/oryx_data) repo. This repo is updated automatically daily at 22:30 EDT/EST.
